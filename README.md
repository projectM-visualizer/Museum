projectM Code Museum
====================

This repository contains very old applications and other code that is unmaintained for years and will not see any
further development. These sources are preserved for historical reasons and also might still be helpful for developing
new projects.

The repository is read-only, and we won't accept pull requests to it. We might still add more stale code to it in the
future.
